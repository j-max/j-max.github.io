    <p>The first week of Metis has presented several challenges.  The first and largest, technical acclimation, one would expect. Less obvious is a challenge associated with the MVP: Minimum Viable Product.  The MVP is, essentially, the bar of acceptability for a given project.  While it is not as fun to define an MVP as it is to start wrangling datasets with code, it is a useful tool in the battle against misuse of energy.</p>

<p>Energy misuse is an obstacle which often complicates the completion of coding projects.  The allure of problem solving which draws many, myself included, to the command line, also sets a trap.  An hour can pass fiddling with an interesting script. While this may be time well spent in less structured circumstances, with a project deadline, such a detour proves costly.   A thoughtful MVP helps one maintain focus. It makes it easier to recognize effort which furthers one’s goals, and effort whose utility is marginal or overly complicated.</p>

<p>An MVP is similar to a research paper’s thesis statement. I would expect that like the craft of thesis writing, that of solid MVP making is a skill hard won.  The trick is defining one which is both feasible and exciting.</p>
