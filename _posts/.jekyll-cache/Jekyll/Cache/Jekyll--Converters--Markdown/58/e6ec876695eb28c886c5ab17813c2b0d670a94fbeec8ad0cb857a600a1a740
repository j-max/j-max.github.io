I"<p>What does Git stand for?</p>

<p>Wikipedia states:</p>

<p>Torvalds quipped about the name git (which means unpleasant person in British English slang): “I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First ‘Linux’, now ‘git’.”</p>

<p>Wikipedia continues in citing the man page, which presents four alternate etymologies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronunciation of “get” may or may not be relevant.</li>
  <li>stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
   dictionary of slang.</li>
  <li>“global information tracker”: you’re in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.</li>
  <li>“goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t”: when it breaks.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the midst of the first Metis project, I’m convinced its origin resides in the phrase,  “Git used to it.”</p>
