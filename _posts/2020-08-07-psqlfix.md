title: Postgresql Fix
---

Quick post on a link to a website that resolved a postgreql error I ran into.  

After running psql from the command line, I received the following error:

```
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```

I came across the solution to my problem from this [webpage](https://k-koh.hatenablog.com/entry/2020/07/13/115340)

I first ran  
```rm /usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid```
followed by   
```brew services restart postgresql```

Not sure if the issue would have been resolved only with the 2nd command, but notheless, after the sequence, I was able to run psql from the command line without issue.
