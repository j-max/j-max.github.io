title: MVP
---

The first week of Metis has presented several challenges.  The first and largest, technical acclimation, one would expect. Less obvious is a challenge associated with the MVP: Minimum Viable Product.  The MVP is, essentially, the bar of acceptability for a given project.  While it is not as fun to define an MVP as it is to start wrangling datasets with code, it is a useful tool in the battle against misuse of energy. 

Energy misuse is an obstacle which often complicates the completion of coding projects.  The allure of problem solving which draws many, myself included, to the command line, also sets a trap.  An hour can pass fiddling with an interesting script. While this may be time well spent in less structured circumstances, with a project deadline, such a detour proves costly.   A thoughtful MVP helps one maintain focus. It makes it easier to recognize effort which furthers one’s goals, and effort whose utility is marginal or overly complicated. 

An MVP is similar to a research paper’s thesis statement. I would expect that like the craft of thesis writing, that of solid MVP making is a skill hard won.  The trick is defining one which is both feasible and exciting.
